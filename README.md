# 286 to breadboard adapter
60-pin breadboard adapter for the 286 processor in PLCC-68 package

## Features
This slim design breadboard adapter for the 286 processor features the essential connections, descriptions, decoupling capacitors and even a small array of debugging leds for the system pin outputs. 

The debugging leds are optional, and may be left unpopulated if desired. The debugging leds may be switched off too by cutting the solder jumper 'JP1', or re-enabled again by soldering the bridge. It is enabled by default.

The adapter may also use J3 to provide power pins on the bottom side that directly connect to the breadboard power lines.
